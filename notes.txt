score = 
sum of values, or maybe more sum of values ^2
+
65536^2 as blank (blank is like the perfect thing)

caracterize an array:
	well, it's the array in memory
	i will compare the whole thing, somehow (strpcpy or somethg like that)
	
for each array, we can identify it
if not all branches were explored, we tried the one we're left with
if branch explored, we pick the best outcome score

that is a lot of array though
2^12 values + blank for 2048
for each cell
2^13*8=
65536 arrays possibles up to 2048?
that's not that much
